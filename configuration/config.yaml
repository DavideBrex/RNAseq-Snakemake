# Prefix to temporary
# Some files -such as fastq- occupy a lot of space. To avoid space problems during the processing of the pipelines
# we can use the temporary scratch of hpcnfs or the scratch directory of each node.
# Just write the prefix-path where you want to put those files, or write '.' to have them in the workdir.
# By now just fastq files will be located in this folder
# IMPORTANT: if you have running multiple snakemake pipelines with the same tmp folder all the fastq files will be located togeter. Care with the sample names to not be repeated.
